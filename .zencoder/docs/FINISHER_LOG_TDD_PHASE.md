## 📋 What Remains (MVP Blockers)

### Critical Path (Before Playtest)
1. **Player Controller Integration**
   - Integrate TopDown Engine's CharacterController
   - Test that player can be controlled via input or AI
   - Verify player health and death state

2. **Enemy Spawning & AI**
   - Implement enemy spawning logic
   - Connect AIBrain to TopDown Engine's AI system
   - Test enemy movement and combat

3. **Scene Setup Validation**
   - Test scene setup scripts generate playable scenes
   - Verify all required managers are created
   - Verify player/enemies/phylactery spawn correctly

4. **Win/Lose Condition Tests**
   - Add tests for phylactery destruction → GameOver
   - Add tests for all enemies dead → Victory
   - Add tests for player respawn mechanics

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Weapon/combat system tests
- [ ] Special ability tests
- [ ] UI feedback tests
- [ ] Audio system tests
- [ ] Performance profiling tests

## 🚀 Next Immediate Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Verify Tests Run in Unity (5 min)
```
1. Open Gorgonzola.sln in Unity
2. Window > General > Test Runner
3. Click "PlayMode" tab
4. Click "Run All"
5. ✅ All 40+ tests should pass (green checkmarks)
```

**Why**: Confirms test infrastructure works end-to-end.

---

### Step 2: Integrate Player Controller (30 min)
Create `PlayerControllerTests.cs`:
```csharp
[UnityTest]
public IEnumerator PlayerController_SpawnsWithHealth_HasTopDownComponents()
{
    var playerGO = new GameObject("Player");
    var controller = playerGO.AddComponent<PlayerController>();
    var health = playerGO.GetComponent<Health>();
    
    Assert.IsNotNull(health);
    Assert.IsTrue(health.CurrentHealth > 0);
    
    yield return null;
    Object.Destroy(playerGO);
}
```

**Why**: Ensures player can exist and be damaged (prerequisite for gameplay).

---

### Step 3: Run Scene Setup & Validate (20 min)
Test that generated scenes have all required components:
```csharp
[UnityTest]
public IEnumerator GeneratedScene_HasAllManagers_Ready()
{
    // Trigger QuickPlaySceneSetup or TopDownEngineSceneSetup
    // Verify: TurnManager, GameManager, InputManager exist
    // Verify: Player, Enemies, Phylactery exist
    // Verify: No null reference errors in Console
    
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);
}
```

**Why**: Confirms scenes can actually be played.

---

### Step 4: Add Win/Lose Condition Tests (30 min)
```csharp
[Test]
public void GameConditions_PhylacteryDestroyedNull_TriggersGameOver()
{
    // Create test phylactery with Health
    // Apply fatal damage
    // Verify GameOver state triggered
}

[Test]
public void GameConditions_AllEnemiesDead_TriggersVictory()
{
    // Create test enemies with Health
    // Apply fatal damage to all
    // Verify Victory state triggered
}
```

**Why**: Defines win/lose states that must work for jam submission.

---

### Step 5: Full Playtest (20 min)
```
1. Use Gorgonzola/Setup/Quick Play or Full Setup
2. Play for 3+ turns
3. Check Console for errors
4. Verify: Player moves, enemies move, turns cycle, no crashes
5. Verify: Damage works, entities die, game state changes
```

**Why**: Human verification that automated tests match reality.

## 💡 Key Insights for Game Jam

### The TDD Approach Ensures
- **Confidence**: If tests pass, code works
- **Debugging**: Clear error messages pinpoint issues
- **Momentum**: No regressions—previous work stays working
- **Submission**: Testable proof the game works

### Common Jam Mistakes (Now Prevented)
- ❌ "It works on my machine" → ✅ Tests verify on all machines
- ❌ Refactoring breaks stuff → ✅ Tests catch immediately
- ❌ Last-minute panic → ✅ Tests show what's working
- ❌ Unclear what's playable → ✅ Tests define playability

### Test Philosophy for Jam
> *"If the tests pass, the game is playable. If tests fail, there's a clear bug to fix. No ambiguity."*

---

## 🚀 Ready to Proceed

**Current Status**: ✅ **TDD infrastructure complete and ready for next phase**

### To Continue:
1. ✅ Run tests in Unity (verify they work)
2. ✅ Create player controller tests
3. ✅ Test scene generation
4. ✅ Add win/lose condition tests
5. ✅ Full playtest
6. ✅ Submit with confidence

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 2-3 hours with tests guiding implementation  
**Confidence Level**: HIGH — We know exactly what we're building and how to verify it works

## 📞 Questions During Jam?

**"Does the game work?"** → Run tests. If all green, yes.  
**"What's broken?"** → Look for red tests. They show exactly what failed.  
**"What should I build next?"** → Write a test for it, watch it fail, then implement it.  
**"How do I know I'm done?"** → All tests pass + manual playtest works.
